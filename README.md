# SSH-Malwares
Here is presented all malwares, SSH keys or other stuffs that are sent by bots or humans that were tricked by my SSH honeypot.
There is malwares from HTTP websiye.
<b>Those files can be harmful so you should not execute them if you don't know what you do</b>.
## SSH keys
In the key folder will be added SSH public keys fingerprint used by bots or compromised machines to access mine. This means those keys are widely compromised and should <b>never be used</b>.
## Malwares
If the bot or compromised machine send a file that is suspicious, it will be added to the malware folder. You can then check if those files are present in your system and take adequate measures. If possible, we will put a file explaining how to remove this malware (if xxx is the malware, xxx_solve is the way to clean). <b>However you should reinstall your system if it is compromised as some includes backdoors</b>.
## HTTP Malwares
Malwares sent to HTTP website in order to access the machine.
## Wanna help?
You can send malwares or comment them by pulling a request. If you have some malwares (sent from bots), you can ask to add them.
